## This term, my experience in typography and coding has been transformative, unveiling the dynamic role design plays in our digital world. Through hands-on projects, I quickly realized that while technology enables endless creativity, impactful design relies on thoughtful planning and detailed testing. For instance, our Week 2 project, which involved creating vintage-style videos from recycled materials, underscored how valuable it is to be resourceful while also highlighting the importance of predicting user interactions in design.
One of the most impactful takeaways for me was understanding the importance of clear communication and precision in both instructions and code. Simple things, like omitting the scale in instructions to draw a soccer ball or making a minor syntax error, can lead to significant misunderstandings or technical issues. This shift in mindset, reinforced by Andy and Karen Ann’s emphasis on paper prototyping, taught me the importance of early planning. Paper prototyping brought ideas to life affordably and helped us explore subtleties that often aren’t evident in code alone, enhancing how we approach user interactions.
The course also introduced me to the evolving importance of digital experiences and sound in design. Seeing projects like Karen’s virtual SKO gallery, inspired by collage art, and learning to integrate sound using tools like Audacity and Jsfxr, opened my eyes to new dimensions in interactive design. Adding sound to my own project, although initially challenging, brought out a depth that added new layers to the user’s experience.
Though I missed a few classes, the online resources provided were essential in helping me stay on track without losing momentum. Andy and Karen Ann’s willingness to share their work and create a collaborative environment taught me that both minor and major mistakes—whether a small syntax error or a conceptual flaw—are part of the learning process, providing chances to refine and grow. Altogether, this course has introduced me to an ever-evolving world of design and has given me skills that I feel are crucial in today’s digital world.
